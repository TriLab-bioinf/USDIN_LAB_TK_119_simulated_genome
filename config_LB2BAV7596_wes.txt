##------arguments for generating sequencing reads------##

## [required] fasta reference file from which reads will be sampled
ref = ./genome.fa

## [required] a model file generated by "seqToProfile" utility
profile = ./LB2BAV7596.profile

## [optional] files defining the variations (indel, SNV and CNV) to simulate
variation = ./variation_file_short_frag.txt

## [optional] file defining the SNPs to simulate
# snp = ./testData/snp.txt

## [optional] file defining target regions for sequencing. If the argument is not specified, sequencing data of all chromosomes defined in the reference will be produced. 
target = ./target.bed

## [required] popolation names (comma-separated).
name = control_short_frag

## [required] output directory
output = ./results

## [optional] sequence layout, should be "SE" for single end or "PE" for paired-end (default: "SE")
layout = PE

## [optional] the number of threads to use (default: 1)
threads = 32

## [optional] print the intermediate information, should be 0 or 1 (default: 1)
verbose = 1

## [required] sequencing coverage
coverage = 150 

## [optional] insert size for paired end sequencing (default: 350, only effective when the "layout" is set to "PE")
insertSize = 150
